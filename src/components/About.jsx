                        I am a full stack web developer from Seattle, WA.
                        I've got multiple experience in developing microservices and scalable applications for both front-end and back-end. Previously,
                        I worked as a user behavior analyst. Although I'm relatively new to the tech industry, after two years of dedicated learning and practice,
                        I see myself as a fast and lifelong learner who loves to dig into whatâ€™s behind the scenes,
                        hence I'm prepared to go all out to demonstrate my abilities.
